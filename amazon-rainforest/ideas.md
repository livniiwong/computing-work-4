_*The Amazon Rainforest*_

Stuck in the Amazon rainforest in utter solitude with razor-sharp branches sticking out and leaves of all types surrounding me, I quivered in fear. My bosom buddies and I had come
to the rainforest together for an escape from our hectic lifestyle in the busy city to catch some fresh, crisp air. We had been tromping around the forest, taking professional
shots of some exotic animals like National Geographic, while we chatted happily. As we relished the joy of not having to review documents and prepare for presentations,
we decided to find an area to rest. In retrospect, that was the calm before the impending storm.

However, when we were caught off guard when a she-bear and her mate suddenly pounced on one of the plastic bags that my buddies have brought to the Amazon Rainforest.
Our primal instincts kicked in and only one word was crystal-clear in my head-- Run! Run for your life! Like how mice scatter when a cat pounces, we sprinted pell-mell 
in all directions. Running as fast as my legs could carry, I did not get a chance to see my friends for the last time. 

Then, as I wandered aimlessly around the forest, swatting the incessant mosquitoes, memories of my family started rushing into my mind and I even thought of whether I would ever
see them again… The only map of the wide expanse of biology that had been laid so rustic when we stood at its entrance was with my missing friends. The macho-like attitude that 
accompanied me when I first stepped into the rainforest had fled, only to give its vacant lot to a timorous attitude with a nagging sense of paranoia and bout of trepidation. 
Negative thoughts whizzed in my head like a pachinko machine as my feet sought solace in resting under a tree. I wrung my hands in despair as the numbing sense of doom slowly
consumed me like a parasite. 

Covering my head with my arms in fear, I wondered if my plight could get any worse. At the same time, I heard an odd, whizzing sound… Slowly, I looked up, and my mental question
was immediately answered as it was staring daggers at me. It was the latest cobra I had ever seen in my life. Its eyes bore into mine, as if hammering a nail into a plank.
“S… snake…” I simpered sycophantically as my mind frantically flipped through a myriad of scenarios. The snake was hanging from a branch, eyeing me with interest. 
Seizing one of the escape plans flitting through my mind, I waited for the perfect opportunity. Just as I prepared to galvanise my legs to scamper, the snake took action and
struck me. 

Its cold and scaly body slid smoothly down my legs, and started to entwine me tightly. Pinning my arms against my sides, it cleverly ensured that I had absolutely no way to escape.
Then, it opened its wide mouth, frightening me. Its maw shone with globules of spittle, and I only had a few milliseconds to make a difference, whether it is to let the snake
devour me or murder it. Laboriously, I began to inch my hand to my moleskin waist pouch. Unfortunately, the more I moved, the tighter the tension between the snake and my leg. 
Desperately, I rummaged through my survival bag hastily and managed to grab a knife. Immediately, I jutted it into the snake’s body. 

Momentarily in shock, the snake slackened its grip on my leg. Weaseling my way out of the snake’s loosened grip, my fear gave wings to my feet, whipping them to run faster.
My heart was palpitating wildly but I ignored it. I had finally figured out my escape route. 

Delirious at the prospect of freedom, I sprinted across the rainforest, my eyes hungrily followed the map’s route. The only thought that constantly rang in my mind was freedom.
I did not want to get stuck in the jungle forever. Stumbling over the several pebbles that lay on the soil, I dashed, until the exit of the Amazon Rainforest loomed
tantalizingly on my periphery. 

As I stepped out of the rainforest, a sense of euphoria gnawed at me. I was free… Finally! I had survived the Amazon Rainforest. I wryly thought to myself… this was indeed an 
experience and I would never want to go through this ever again.
